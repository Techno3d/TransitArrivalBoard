# Contributing to Transit Arrival Board

The Transit Arrival Board was designed to be as future-proof as possible with little to no maintanence in mind. However, we anticipate that this cannot last forever, especially if the MTA's APIs change.

If you find a problem, please take the time to contribute. This project was made for a high school (Bronx High School of Science), and maintainers will come and go every 4 years, so we need all the help we can get.
