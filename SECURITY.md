## Reporting a Vulnerability

The transit arrival board was designed to be as future-proof as possible with litle to no maintanence in mind. It is intended to run on a television dispay, so there should not be any personal information or accounts stored on the same device. As a result, it is not likely for us to address security concerns should they arise, espically if the solution is to update to a new release with breaking changes.
