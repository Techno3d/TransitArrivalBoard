# Transit Arrival Board

A hobby project that uses the MTA bus and subway APIs to get realtime transit info about public transit near Bronx Science

Code quality is not the best but I made do with what I knew.

## How to build

You need to make a .env file with two keys
NYCTKEY=your-api-key
MTABUSKEY=your-bus-api-key

A subway api key can be gotten at the mta developer portal [here](https://api.mta.info/#/landing)
And the mta bus api key can be gotten at the mta bustime developer page [here](http://www.bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/Index)
